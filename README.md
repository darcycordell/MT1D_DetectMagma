# MT1D_DetectMagma
Repository for scripts related to Cordell et al. "Estimating melt fraction in silicic systems using Bayesian inversion of magnetotelluric data" 
(submitted to Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research)

Synthetic data and MATLAB scripts required to re-create plots for the figures.

The primary scripts to run are:

Run_MCMC_JVGR.m: Code which reads model txt files, creates synthetic data, and runs MCMC inversion

To run the scripts, open them in MATLAB and run each code block. See comments in scripts for more details.

Other underlying functions are also included but these do not need to be edited or opened by the user.
